add support for loading TypeScript Svelte config files in runtimes that support it

> **NOTE**
> This change only applies to vite-plugin-svelte.
>
> To use `svelte.config.ts` in SvelteKit, with the Svelte VS Code extension or other tools reading the Svelte config file, you have to wait until support is implemented there.
